Absolutely, let's delve into the `NetRunner` class step by step:

### 1. Initialization (`__init__` method)

When an instance of `NetRunner` is created, the following parameters need to be provided:

- `name`: A string to name the network.
- `input_size`: The number of neurons in the input layer.
- `hidden_size`: The number of neurons in the hidden layer.
- `output_size`: The number of neurons in the output layer.
- `net_type`: An integer to select the network type from a predefined dictionary.

Upon initialization:

- The provided parameters are stored as attributes.
- A dictionary (`self.types`) is defined to map integers (`net_type`) to string descriptions of network types.
- `create_network` method is called to initialize the network's weights and biases.

### 2. Network Creation (`create_network` method)

This method initializes the weights and biases for the network:

- `W1` and `b1`: Weights and biases from the input layer to the hidden layer.
- `W2` and `b2`: Weights and biases from the hidden layer to the output layer.
Weights are initialized with random values, and biases are initialized to zero.

### 3. Activation Function (`sigmoid` method)

The `sigmoid` method takes a numerical input (`z`) and applies the sigmoid function:
\[ \sigma(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}} \]
It's commonly used in binary classification problems and serves to squash the input into a range between 0 and 1.

### 4. Derivative of Activation Function (`sigmoid_derivative` method)

This method computes the derivative of the sigmoid function, which is used during backpropagation to calculate gradients:
\[ \sigma'(z) = \sigma(z) \times (1 - \sigma(z)) \]

### 5. Feedforward (`feedforward` method)

Given an input `X`, this method:

- Computes the linear combination of inputs and weights (`z1`) and applies the sigmoid activation function (`a1`) for the hidden layer.
- Computes the linear combination of `a1` and second-layer weights (`z2`), and applies the sigmoid activation function (`a2`) for the output layer.
- `a2` represents the network's prediction and is returned by the method.

### 6. Loss Computation (`compute_loss` method)

This method computes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the predicted output (`y_pred`) and the actual output (`y_true`):
\[ \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} (y_{\text{pred},i} - y_{\text{true},i})^2 \]
where `m` is the number of training examples.

### 7. Backpropagation (`backpropagate` method)

Given input `X`, true output `y`, and a `learning_rate`, this method:

- Computes the error in the output layer (`dz2`) as the difference between predicted output and true output.
- Computes the gradient of the loss w.r.t. second-layer weights and biases (`dw2` and `db2`).
- Computes the error in the hidden layer (`dz1`) using `dz2` and the derivative of the activation function.
- Computes the gradient of the loss w.r.t. first-layer weights and biases (`dw1` and `db1`).
- Updates the weights and biases using the computed gradients and the learning rate.

### 8. Training (`train` method)

Given input `X`, true output `y`, number of `epochs`, and a `learning_rate`, this method:

- Iteratively performs the feedforward and backpropagation processes for the specified number of epochs.
- Computes and prints the loss at each epoch.
- Stores the loss, weights, and biases at each epoch in an output dictionary (`output_dict`).

### Usage Flow

1. **Initialization**: Create an instance of `NetRunner` and specify the network parameters.
2. **Training**: Call the `train` method with training data, desired epochs, and learning rate.
3. **Prediction**: Use the `feedforward` method with new data to make predictions (not explicitly defined in the class but typically follows training).

### Example Usage

```python
# Initialize the network
network = NetRunner(name="ExampleNetwork", input_size=3, hidden_size=5, output_size=1, net_type=1)

# Assume X_train and y_train are your training data and labels
# Train the network
output_dict = network.train(X_train, y_train, epochs=1000, learning_rate=0.01)

# Make predictions (after modifying the class to include a prediction method)
# predictions = network.predict(X_new)
```
