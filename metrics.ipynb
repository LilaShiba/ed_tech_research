It captures the heterogeneity in the types and properties of neurons present in a network.

Evaluate the total number of neurons: Count the total number of neurons present in the network. This includes both the input and output neurons, as well as all the neurons in the hidden layers.\\\\n\\\\n2. Assess the diversity of neuron types: Analyze the different types of neurons present in the network. Neurons can have varying activation functions, connectivity patterns, or other properties. By examining the diversity of these neural elements, we can gain insights into the width of the network.\\\\n\\\\n3. Calculate the ratio of diverse neurons: Divide the number of diverse neurons by the total number of neurons in the network. This ratio will provide a measure of how wide the neural network is in terms of neural diversity.\\\\n\\\\nIt\\'s important to note that this approach may not capture all aspects of network width, as it focuses primarily on the diversity of neuron types.
